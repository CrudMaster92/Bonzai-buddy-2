summary: |
  The applets directory contains all plug-in experiences that Nimbus can launch. Each
  applet is self-contained and must declare its own metadata and agent guidance files.
objectives:
  - Keep applet code isolated to its folder with no shared mutable state.
  - Document every applet with `agents.md` and `agents.yaml` to guide contributors.
  - Require registration through the root `applets.json` registry before Nimbus displays it.
constraints:
  - Applets must load through iframes or separate windows; never rely on direct imports.
  - All assets and dependencies should live inside the applet folder.
  - Avoid referencing the Nimbus implementation details from within applets.
success_criteria:
  - Adding a folder with the expected files and registering it exposes the applet in Nimbus.
  - Removing an applet folder cleanly deregisters it without side effects.
  - Each applet clearly states its permissions and expectations inside its metadata.
