summary: |
  Nimbus Buddy is the primary desktop companion and launcher for every isolated applet
  in the workspace. It replaces the traditional dashboard UI with a persistent, draggable
  assistant that surfaces the registered mini-apps.
objectives:
  - Keep the Nimbus shell lightweight and dependency-free (vanilla HTML, CSS, JS).
  - Load applet metadata dynamically from the root registry without manual wiring.
  - Provide an accessible surface for selecting applets and managing buddy visibility.
  - Support cosmetic "skins" that can be swapped without altering applet integrations.
constraints:
  - Do not couple applet logic or assets into the Nimbus bundle.
  - Avoid theme palettes that mirror the old cosmic purple/glassmorphism aesthetic.
  - Maintain strict iframe-based isolation when applets are embedded.
  - Preserve responsiveness for desktop and tablet layouts.
success_criteria:
  - Nimbus can be repositioned, minimized, and restored without page refreshes.
  - Adding an entry to applets.json surfaces a new applet in the buddy menu automatically.
  - Swapping the active skin updates visuals via data attributes or CSS variables only.
  - Network failures while loading applets.json show a friendly, recoverable state.
